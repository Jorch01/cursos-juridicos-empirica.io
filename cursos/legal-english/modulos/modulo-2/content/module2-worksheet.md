# PART 2: READING - CONTRACT FORMATION (15 minutes)

## Text: Essential Elements of a Valid Contract

Read the following text carefully.

> In Anglo-American common law, a valid contract requires four essential elements: **offer**, **acceptance**, **consideration**, and **intention to create legal relations**. This differs significantly from civil law systems like Mexico's, where *causa* (cause) replaces consideration.
>
> An **offer** must be clear, definite, and communicated to the offeree. The principle of *consensus ad idem* (meeting of minds) means both parties must agree on the same terms. **Acceptance** must mirror the offer exactly—any changes constitute a counter-offer. This is called the "mirror image rule."
>
> **Consideration** is uniquely important in common law. Each party must provide something of value: money, goods, services, or even a promise to do (or not do) something. The Latin maxim *quid pro quo* ("something for something") captures this concept. Without consideration, a promise is merely a gift, unenforceable in court.
>
> When unforeseen events prevent performance, parties may invoke **force majeure** (*vis major* in Latin). However, unlike Mexican law where *caso fortuito* is codified in the Civil Code, common law has no general doctrine of force majeure. Parties must include specific clauses in their contracts.
>
> The recent UK Supreme Court case **MUR Shipping BV v. RTI Ltd [2024]** clarified that "reasonable endeavours" to overcome force majeure does not require accepting non-contractual performance. The court upheld the principle of *pacta sunt servanda*—agreements must be kept as written.

## Comparative Table: Contract Formation

| Element | United States | United Kingdom | Mexico |
|---------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **Basic requirement** | Offer + Acceptance + Consideration | Offer + Acceptance + Consideration | Consentimiento + Objeto + Causa |
| **Consideration** | Required for enforceability | Required for enforceability | Not required (*causa* instead) |
| **Written form** | Statute of Frauds for certain contracts | Similar requirements | More contracts require written form |
| **Force majeure** | Must be in contract | Must be in contract | Codified in Civil Code (Art. 2111) |
| **Good faith** | Implied in performance (UCC) | Limited application | Fundamental principle |

# PART 3: LISTENING - THE MUR SHIPPING CASE (15 minutes)

## Pre-Listening

### Case Context
In 2024, the UK Supreme Court decided **RTI Ltd v. MUR Shipping BV**, a landmark case about force majeure clauses and sanctions. MUR Shipping agreed to transport bauxite from Guinea to Ukraine. When US sanctions made dollar payments difficult, a dispute arose about whether accepting payment in euros was required.

### Prediction Questions
Before listening, discuss or think about:
1. What problems might sanctions cause for international contracts?
2. Should a party accept alternative payment if it causes them no loss?
3. What does "reasonable endeavours" mean to you?

> "On April 6, 2018, RTI's parent company was placed on the (4)______________ Designated Nationals List by OFAC. This meant that dollar payments would be subject to (5)______________ and potential delays."
>
> "MUR served a force majeure (6)______________, stating they could not continue without receiving payment as contractually (7)______________. RTI rejected this and offered to pay in (8)______________ instead."
>
> "The central legal question was: does the obligation to use (9)______________ endeavours require accepting (10)______________-contractual performance?"

| *quid pro quo* | Something for something | Consideration is the common law *quid pro quo* |
| *vis major* | Superior force | *Vis major* events may excuse non-performance |

# PART 5: SPEAKING PRACTICE (5 minutes)

## Discussion Questions
Practice answering these questions orally:

1. **Compare systems:** How does force majeure work differently in Mexican law (*caso fortuito*) compared to English law?

2. **Apply the case:** If you were RTI's lawyer, what arguments would you make to show MUR should have accepted euros?

3. **Professional context:** Why is it important for Mexican lawyers working internationally to understand common law contract principles?

---

## Role-Play Scenario

**Situation:** You are a Mexican lawyer advising a client who has a contract with a US company. The contract requires payment in US dollars, but new currency restrictions make this difficult.

**Task:** Explain to your client (in English) what the MUR Shipping case means for their situation.

Consider:
- The importance of the exact contract terms
- Whether "reasonable endeavours" requires accepting alternatives
- What the client should propose to the US company

---

📧 **Practice Task:** Write a brief email (50-100 words) to jorge_clemente@empirica.mx explaining:
- The main holding of MUR Shipping v. RTI
- How this might apply to a Mexican client's situation

---

## 📝 Module Summary

### Key Takeaways
✅ Common law contracts require offer, acceptance, consideration, and intent

✅ Force majeure must be explicitly included in common law contracts

✅ "Reasonable endeavours" does not require accepting non-contractual performance

✅ *Pacta sunt servanda*: the contract terms as written control

✅ Mexican lawyers must draft force majeure clauses carefully for international contracts

---

💡 **Tip:** When reviewing international contracts, always check if force majeure is defined and what "reasonable endeavours" obligations exist.
