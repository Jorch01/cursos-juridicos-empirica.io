# PART 2: READING ANSWERS

## Exercise 3: True or False

1. **F** - In common law, consideration is optional for contract validity.
   - **Correction:** Consideration is REQUIRED for contract validity in common law.

2. **T** - The "mirror image rule" means acceptance must match the offer exactly.
   - *(No correction needed)*

3. **F** - Mexican law requires consideration just like US and UK law.
   - **Correction:** Mexican law does NOT require consideration; it uses *causa* instead.

4. **F** - Force majeure is automatically implied in all English law contracts.
   - **Correction:** Force majeure must be EXPLICITLY INCLUDED in English law contracts; it is not implied.

5. **T** - *Pacta sunt servanda* means contracts must be performed as agreed.
   - *(No correction needed)*

## Exercise 4: Comprehension Questions

1. **What are the four essential elements of a valid contract in common law?**
   
   The four essential elements are: (1) offer, (2) acceptance, (3) consideration, and (4) intention to create legal relations.

2. **What is the "mirror image rule" and why is it important?**
   
   The mirror image rule requires that acceptance must match the offer exactly. Any changes to the terms constitute a counter-offer, not an acceptance. This is important because it ensures both parties are agreeing to the same terms (*consensus ad idem*).

3. **How does Mexican law differ from common law regarding consideration?**
   
   Mexican law (civil law system) does not require consideration. Instead, it uses *causa* (cause) as the underlying purpose or reason for the contract. A contract can be valid in Mexico without the exchange of value that common law requires.

4. **Why must force majeure clauses be explicitly included in common law contracts?**
   
   Unlike Mexican law where *caso fortuito* is codified in the Civil Code, common law has no general doctrine of force majeure. If parties want protection from unforeseeable events, they must draft specific clauses into their contracts.

## Exercise 5: Find the Words

1. A Latin phrase meaning "meeting of minds": ***consensus ad idem***

2. Something given in exchange for something else: **consideration** (or *quid pro quo*)

3. The Latin term for "agreements must be kept": ***pacta sunt servanda***

4. A superior force that prevents contract performance: **force majeure** (or *vis major*)

5. The requirement that acceptance must exactly match the offer: **mirror image rule**

# PART 3: LISTENING ANSWERS

## 🎧 AUDIO TRANSCRIPT

**[TRACK 2.1 - MUR SHIPPING CASE OVERVIEW]**
*Duration: 4 minutes 30 seconds*

---

**NARRATOR:** Welcome to Module 2. Today we examine the landmark UK Supreme Court case RTI Limited versus MUR Shipping BV, decided in May 2024. This case clarifies how force majeure clauses work when sanctions interfere with contractual payments.

**[Sound effect: Ship horn]**

**NARRATOR:** In June 2016, MUR Shipping BV and RTI Ltd entered into a contract of affreightment for the carriage of bauxite from Guinea to Ukraine. The contract specified that all payments must be made in US dollars.

Everything proceeded smoothly until April 2018. On April 6, 2018, RTI's parent company—United Company Rusal—was placed on the Specially Designated Nationals List by OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control. This meant that dollar payments would be subject to restrictions and potential delays.

**[Sound effect: Paper shuffling]**

**NARRATOR:** Four days later, MUR served a force majeure notice, stating they could not continue without receiving payment as contractually agreed. Specifically, Clause 36 of the contract contained a force majeure provision. To qualify as force majeure, an event had to meet several criteria, including that it "cannot be overcome by reasonable endeavours."

**[Sound effect: Telephone ringing]**

**NARRATOR:** RTI rejected the force majeure notice. They offered to pay in euros instead of dollars and agreed to cover all currency conversion costs. RTI argued this would cause MUR no financial detriment whatsoever.

But MUR refused. They maintained their contractual right to receive US dollars, not euros. MUR suspended performance under the contract.

**[Sound effect: Gavel]**

**NARRATOR:** RTI commenced arbitration for breach of contract. The central legal question was: does the obligation to use reasonable endeavours require accepting non-contractual performance?

The arbitration tribunal ruled in favor of RTI, saying MUR should have accepted euros. The Commercial Court disagreed and allowed MUR's appeal. Then the Court of Appeal sided with RTI again. Finally, the case reached the UK Supreme Court.

**[Sound effect: Formal announcement tone]**

**NARRATOR:** On May 15, 2024, the Supreme Court delivered a unanimous decision. The court overturned the Court of Appeal and ruled in favor of MUR Shipping. The principle of pacta sunt servanda was central to the decision.

Lord Hamblen, writing for the court, stated that reasonable endeavours clauses ensure a causal connection between the force majeure event and non-performance. They do not require accepting performance that differs from what the contract specifies.

The court emphasized that freedom of contract is fundamental to English commercial law. Clear words are needed to give up valuable contractual rights. MUR was entitled to receive dollars, as agreed. They did not have to accept euros, even if it would cause them no loss.

**[Sound effect: Paper stamp]**

**NARRATOR:** This case has major implications for international commerce. Force majeure clauses must be drafted carefully. The terms you write are the terms you must live with—and the terms you can enforce.

**[End of recording]**

1. "Reasonable endeavours require accepting payment in euros since there would be no detriment to MUR." — **B (RTI's lawyers) and D (Court of Appeal)**

2. "We are entitled to receive payment in US dollars as specified in the contract." — **A (MUR Shipping's lawyers)**

3. "A party cannot be forced to accept non-contractual performance without clear wording." — **C (The Supreme Court)**

4. "The purpose of the payment clause would still be achieved with euros." — **D (The Court of Appeal)** *(also B)*

# PART 4: PRACTICAL APPLICATION ANSWERS

## Exercise 9: Identify Elements

1. **Who is protected from liability under this clause?**
   
   Both Owners (MUR Shipping) and Charterers (RTI) are protected from liability for loss, damage, delay, or failure in performance caused by a Force Majeure Event.

2. **What four criteria must be met for an event to qualify as force majeure?**

   a) The event must be outside the immediate control of the party giving notice.
   
   b) The event must prevent or delay the loading or discharge of cargo.
   
   c) The event must be caused by one of the listed events (including sanctions).
   
   d) The event cannot be overcome by reasonable endeavours from the affected party.

3. **What is the significance of criterion (d) for the MUR Shipping case?**
   
   Criterion (d) was the central issue in the case. RTI argued that MUR could have "overcome" the sanctions issue by accepting euros, meaning criterion (d) was not satisfied. The Supreme Court ruled that "reasonable endeavours" does not require accepting non-contractual performance, so criterion (d) WAS satisfied and MUR could rely on force majeure.

4. **Does this clause excuse all types of non-performance? Explain.**
   
   No. The clause only excuses non-performance caused by events meeting ALL four criteria. Additionally, the clause specifically covers "loading or discharge of the cargo" — it does not necessarily cover all contractual obligations. The event must also be one of the specified types listed in the clause.

## Exercise 10: Complete the Template

**Model Answer:**

1. **June 9, 2016** (the date of the original contract)

2. **36** (the force majeure clause number)

3. **The imposition of US sanctions by OFAC on RTI's parent company, United Company Rusal, effective April 6, 2018. RTI, as a majority-owned subsidiary, is subject to the same restrictions, creating restrictions on monetary transfers in US dollars.**

4. **US dollar payments from Charterers to Owners will be subject to significant delays and potential blocking while banks conduct sanctions compliance checks. We cannot be expected to load and discharge cargo without receiving timely payment in accordance with the Contract.**

5. **The sanctions are imposed by a foreign government (United States) and are outside our control. There is no legal mechanism available to us to remove RTI or its parent from the sanctions list. The restrictions on dollar payments cannot be overcome through any reasonable steps we might take.**

## Exercise 11: Match Latin Terms

| Latin Term | Answer |
|------------|--------|
| 1. *pacta sunt servanda* | **d** - agreements must be kept |
| 2. *consensus ad idem* | **f** - meeting of minds |
| 3. *quid pro quo* | **b** - something for something |
| 4. *vis major* | **e** - superior/irresistible force |
| 5. *bona fide* | **a** - in good faith |
| 6. *ex contractu* | **c** - arising from the contract |

# INSTRUCTOR NOTES

## Common Student Errors

1. **Consideration vs. Causa:** Students often conflate these concepts. Emphasize that consideration requires actual exchange of value, while *causa* is about the purpose or reason.

2. **Force Majeure Confusion:** Mexican students expect force majeure to be implied (as *caso fortuito* is in Mexican law). Stress that common law requires explicit clauses.

3. **Reasonable Endeavours:** Students may think this requires doing "everything possible." Clarify it means what a reasonable businessperson would do, not heroic measures—and per MUR Shipping, not accepting different performance terms.

4. **Latin Pronunciation:** Practice *pacta sunt servanda* (/ˈpæktə sʊnt sɜːrˈvændə/) and *vis major* (/vɪs ˈmeɪdʒər/).

## Extension Activities

- Have students draft a force majeure clause for a Mexico-US contract
- Discuss how COVID-19 affected force majeure claims globally
- Compare the MUR Shipping case with Mexican Supreme Court decisions on *caso fortuito*

## Cultural Notes for Mexican Students

- In Mexico, *buena fe* (good faith) permeates all contract law; in common law, it's more limited
- Mexican lawyers should advise clients that common law contracts are interpreted literally—the written words control
- When drafting for international parties, explicitly define all force majeure events and remedies
