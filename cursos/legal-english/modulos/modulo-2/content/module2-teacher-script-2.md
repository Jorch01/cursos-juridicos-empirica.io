# SEGMENT 4: LISTENING — THE MUR SHIPPING CASE
## ⏱️ TIMECODE: 25:00 - 38:00

---

### [25:00] PRE-LISTENING CONTEXT

**[On screen: MUR Shipping case summary card]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Now we get to the heart of this module—a real case from the UK Supreme Court decided in May 2024. This isn't ancient history. This is current law that affects contracts being signed today.

**[Ship image appears]**

Let me set the scene.

MUR Shipping BV is a Dutch shipping company—the shipowner. RTI Ltd is a company that needed to transport bauxite—that's the ore used to make aluminum—from Guinea in West Africa to Ukraine. They signed a contract of affreightment. That's a shipping contract for cargo transport by sea.

**[Contract icon appears]**

The contract had two key features:
1. RTI would pay MUR in US dollars
2. The contract included a force majeure clause—specifically, Clause 36

Everything was fine until April 2018. That's when the United States imposed sanctions on RTI's parent company, United Company Rusal, a Russian aluminum giant. Because RTI was majority-owned by Rusal, RTI became subject to the same sanctions.

**[Dollar sign with prohibition symbol]**

Here's the problem: dollar payments would now be flagged, delayed, possibly blocked by banks doing sanctions compliance. MUR said, 'We can't receive payment as the contract requires. Force majeure.'

RTI said, 'Wait. We'll pay you in euros. We'll cover all conversion costs. You won't lose a single penny.'

MUR said, 'No. The contract says dollars. We want dollars.'

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the dispute that went all the way to the UK Supreme Court.

The question: Does 'reasonable endeavours' to overcome force majeure require accepting payment in a different currency when it causes no financial loss?

**[Pause for effect]**

What do you think the answer should be? Hold that thought. Let's listen to the full story."

---

### [28:00] LISTENING EXERCISE SETUP

**[On screen: Pre-listening questions]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Before we play the audio, look at the pre-listening questions in your worksheet:

1. What problems might sanctions cause for international contracts?
2. Should a party accept alternative payment if it causes them no loss?
3. What does 'reasonable endeavours' mean to you?

Think about these as you listen. There's no single right answer to questions 2 and 3—these are the questions the courts struggled with.

**[Audio player icon appears]**

I'll play the recording now. It's about four and a half minutes. For Exercise 6, tick the statements you hear mentioned. You don't need to answer yet—just listen and mark what you hear.

**[Pause indicator: "PLAYING AUDIO — Listen and complete Exercise 6"]**

Here we go."

### [28:45] AUDIO PLAYBACK
**[Audio file plays — 4:30 duration]**
**[On screen: Subtle visual indicating audio is playing, perhaps ship imagery or case timeline graphic]**

---

### [33:15] EXERCISE 6 REVIEW

**[On screen: Exercise 6 checklist]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Excellent. Let's check Exercise 6. Which statements did you hear in the recording?

**[Go through each statement]**

'MUR Shipping was the shipowner' — **YES, you heard this.** ✓

'The contract was for oil transportation' — **NO.** ✗ The contract was for bauxite, not oil. That's aluminum ore.

'Payment was required in US dollars' — **YES.** ✓ This was a key contract term.

'RTI's parent company was placed on a sanctions list' — **YES.** ✓ United Company Rusal was placed on the Specially Designated Nationals List by OFAC.

'MUR offered to accept euros' — **NO.** ✗ This is the opposite! RTI offered euros. MUR refused.

'RTI offered to pay the currency conversion costs' — **YES.** ✓ RTI offered to cover any conversion costs or exchange rate losses.

'The arbitration tribunal ruled in favor of MUR' — **NO.** ✗ The tribunal ruled in favor of RTI, saying MUR should have accepted euros.

'The Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal' — **YES.** ✓ The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal and ruled for MUR.

'The case was about breach of contract' — This one is **tricky.** RTI claimed breach, but the core issue was force majeure. I'll accept either answer, but technically the case centered on force majeure, not breach. Mark it as you wish.

'The principle of *pacta sunt servanda* was discussed' — **YES.** ✓ The court emphasized that contracts must be kept as written.

How many did you get? Seven or more correct means you're listening well."

### [35:00] EXERCISE 7 — GAP-FILL LISTENING

**[On screen: Exercise 7 with gaps]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Now let's do Exercise 7. I'll play portions of the audio again. Fill in the gaps.

**[Audio clips play for each section]**

**[After playback]**

Let's check:

Gap 1: **affreightment** — A contract of affreightment is for sea cargo transport.

Gap 2: **bauxite** — The ore used to make aluminum.

Gap 3: **dollars** — US dollars, specifically.

Gap 4: **Specially** — The Specially Designated Nationals List.

Gap 5: **restrictions** — Dollar payments would be subject to restrictions and delays.

Gap 6: **notice** — MUR served a force majeure notice.

Gap 7: **agreed** — Payment as contractually agreed.

Gap 8: **euros** — RTI offered to pay in euros.

Gap 9: **reasonable** — Reasonable endeavours.

Gap 10: **non** — Non-contractual performance.

The key phrase is 'non-contractual performance.' Paying in euros when the contract says dollars is non-contractual. The Supreme Court said you don't have to accept that."

---

### [37:00] EXERCISE 8 — MATCH SPEAKERS

**[On screen: Exercise 8]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Exercise 8. Match the speakers with their arguments.

**[Statements appear]**

Statement 1: 'Reasonable endeavours require accepting payment in euros since there would be no detriment to MUR.'

Who argued this? This was **RTI's lawyers—answer B**. The Court of Appeal agreed with them too, so **D** also works.

Statement 2: 'We are entitled to receive payment in US dollars as specified in the contract.'

This is clearly **MUR Shipping's lawyers—answer A**. They stood firm on the contract terms.

Statement 3: 'A party cannot be forced to accept non-contractual performance without clear wording.'

This is **the Supreme Court—answer C**. This is the holding of the case.

Statement 4: 'The purpose of the payment clause would still be achieved with euros.'

This was the reasoning of **the Court of Appeal—answer D**. They said the purpose was to get MUR the right amount of money, and euros could achieve that.

The Supreme Court disagreed. They said you don't look at the 'purpose' behind a clause—you look at what the clause actually says. *Pacta sunt servanda*. The contract says dollars, MUR gets dollars."

# SEGMENT 5: PRACTICAL APPLICATION
## ⏱️ TIMECODE: 38:00 - 50:00

---

### [38:00] DOCUMENT ANALYSIS INTRODUCTION

**[On screen: Actual Clause 36 text displayed]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Time to analyze a real document. This is Clause 36 from the MUR Shipping contract—the actual force majeure clause that was litigated. Let's read it carefully.

**[Read clause aloud, pointing to each element]**

'36.1 Subject to the terms of this Clause 36, neither Owners nor Charterers shall be liable to the other for loss, damage, delay or failure in performance caused by a Force Majeure Event as hereinafter defined.'

So this clause protects both parties—owners AND charterers—from liability. It covers loss, damage, delay, and failure in performance. Broad protection.

'36.3 A Force Majeure Event is an event or state of affairs which meets ALL of the following criteria...'

**[Emphasize 'ALL']**

ALL. Not some. Not most. ALL four criteria must be met.

'(a) It is outside the immediate control of the Party giving the Force Majeure Notice'

Criterion A: Outside control. US sanctions are certainly outside a private company's control.

'(b) It prevents or delays the loading or discharge of the cargo'

Criterion B: Prevents or delays loading or discharge. The sanctions affected payments, which affected MUR's willingness to ship.

'(c) It is caused by one or more of [listed events including sanctions]'

Criterion C: Must be a listed event. Sanctions were specifically listed. Check.

'(d) It cannot be overcome by reasonable endeavours from the Party affected.'

Criterion D. Here's where the case turned. RTI said MUR could overcome the payment problem by accepting euros—reasonable endeavours. MUR said no, accepting euros isn't required.

Who was right? The Supreme Court said MUR. Reasonable endeavours means efforts to perform the CONTRACT. Not efforts to accept DIFFERENT performance."

---

### [41:00] EXERCISE 9

**[On screen: Exercise 9 questions]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Complete Exercise 9. Four questions about the clause.

**[Pause indicator: "PAUSE VIDEO — Complete Exercise 9 — 3 minutes"]**

Pause the video. Three minutes.

**[Beat]**

Answers:

Question 1: Who is protected from liability under this clause?

**Both Owners—that's MUR Shipping—and Charterers—that's RTI—are protected** from liability for loss, damage, delay, or failure in performance caused by a Force Majeure Event. The clause is mutual.

Question 2: What four criteria must be met?

**(a) The event must be outside the immediate control of the party giving notice.**

**(b) The event must prevent or delay the loading or discharge of cargo.**

**(c) The event must be caused by one of the listed events—including sanctions.**

**(d) The event cannot be overcome by reasonable endeavours.**

All four. Missing even one means you can't invoke force majeure.

Question 3: What is the significance of criterion (d) for the MUR Shipping case?

**This was the central issue.** RTI argued that criterion (d) was not satisfied because MUR could have 'overcome' the sanctions problem by accepting euros. The Supreme Court ruled that 'reasonable endeavours' does NOT require accepting non-contractual performance, so criterion (d) WAS satisfied and MUR could rely on force majeure.

Question 4: Does this clause excuse all types of non-performance?

**No.** The clause specifically covers events affecting 'loading or discharge of cargo.' It must be a listed type of event. And all four criteria must be met. It's not a blanket excuse for any non-performance."

---

### [44:00] EXERCISE 10 — DRAFTING A FORCE MAJEURE NOTICE

**[On screen: Notice template]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Now for practical drafting. Exercise 10 asks you to complete a force majeure notice template as if you were MUR's lawyer.

This is exactly the kind of document you might draft in practice. Let's go through it.

**[Pause indicator: "PAUSE VIDEO — Complete Exercise 10 — 4 minutes"]**

Pause and complete the template.

**[Beat]**

Let's see a model answer.

**[Template fills in as instructor reads]**

Gap 1: The contract date. That's **June 9, 2016**. Always reference the original contract precisely.

Gap 2: The clause number. **Clause 36**. Be specific about which clause you're invoking.

Gap 3: What is the Force Majeure Event? Here's a model:

**'The imposition of US sanctions by OFAC on RTI's parent company, United Company Rusal, effective April 6, 2018. RTI, as a majority-owned subsidiary, is subject to the same restrictions, creating restrictions on monetary transfers in US dollars.'**

Notice how this is factual, specific, and ties to the contract.

Gap 4: Why does this prevent performance?

**'US dollar payments from Charterers to Owners will be subject to significant delays and potential blocking while banks conduct sanctions compliance checks. We cannot be expected to load and discharge cargo without receiving timely payment in accordance with the Contract.'**

You connect the event to your specific obligation under the contract.

Gap 5: Why can't you overcome this?

**'The sanctions are imposed by a foreign government—the United States—and are outside our control. There is no legal mechanism available to us to remove RTI or its parent from the sanctions list. The restrictions on dollar payments cannot be overcome through any reasonable steps we might take.'**

This addresses criterion (d) directly. You explain why no reasonable endeavours can overcome the problem.

This is how you write a force majeure notice. Precise. Factual. Tied to the contract language. If you ever need to invoke force majeure, this is your template."

### [47:00] LEGAL LATIN REVIEW

**[On screen: Latin terms table]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Before we finish, let's consolidate the Latin terms from this module. You've seen them in context—now let's make sure you can use them.

**[Terms appear one by one]**

***Pacta sunt servanda*** — Agreements must be kept. The central principle of contract law. When MUR said 'the contract says dollars,' they were invoking *pacta sunt servanda*.

***Consensus ad idem*** — Meeting of minds. Both parties must agree to the same terms. Essential for contract formation.

***Quid pro quo*** — Something for something. The essence of consideration in common law. You give, I give.

***Vis major*** — Superior force. The Latin origin of force majeure. An irresistible force beyond human control.

***Bona fide*** — In good faith. While less central in English law than Mexican law, still an important concept.

***Ex contractu*** — Arising from the contract. Damages *ex contractu* are damages arising from breach of contract, as opposed to *ex delicto*—from tort."

---

### [48:00] EXERCISE 11

**[On screen: Exercise 11]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Quick final exercise. Match the Latin terms with their English equivalents.

**[Pause indicator: "PAUSE VIDEO — Complete Exercise 11 — 1 minute"]**

One minute.

**[Beat]**

Answers:

1. *Pacta sunt servanda* matches **D** — agreements must be kept.

2. *Consensus ad idem* matches **F** — meeting of minds.

3. *Quid pro quo* matches **B** — something for something.

4. *Vis major* matches **E** — superior or irresistible force.

5. *Bona fide* matches **A** — in good faith.

6. *Ex contractu* matches **C** — arising from the contract.

Use these terms. They're not pretentious—they're precise. Legal professionals worldwide understand them."

## ⏱️ TIMECODE: 50:00 - 55:00

### [50:00] DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

**[On screen: Three discussion questions]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Final segment: Speaking Practice. Three questions to help you articulate what you've learned.

**[Question 1 appears]**

Question 1: How does force majeure work differently in Mexican law—*caso fortuito*—compared to English law?

Think about this: In Mexico, *caso fortuito* and *fuerza mayor* are codified in Article 2111 of the Civil Code. You get protection automatically if the event meets the legal definition. In English law, nothing is automatic. You must write force majeure into your contract. If you don't, you're stuck with frustration doctrine—which is much harder to invoke.

**[Question 2 appears]**

Question 2: If you were RTI's lawyer, what arguments would you make to show MUR should have accepted euros?

RTI's lawyers argued: MUR would suffer no financial loss. The purpose of the payment clause—getting MUR the right amount of money—would be achieved. Refusing euros was commercially unreasonable. The Court of Appeal agreed! But the Supreme Court said no—the contract is the contract.

**[Question 3 appears]**

Question 3: Why is it important for Mexican lawyers working internationally to understand common law contract principles?

Because you WILL work with US and UK contracts. Your clients will sign them. You will negotiate them. You need to know that consideration is required, that force majeure must be explicit, that the written words control. Misunderstanding these principles could be malpractice."

---

### [52:00] ROLE-PLAY SCENARIO

**[On screen: Scenario description]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Here's a practice scenario.

You're a Mexican lawyer. Your client has a contract with a US company requiring payment in US dollars. New currency restrictions make dollar payments difficult.

How do you advise your client?

Based on what we learned today:

First, review the contract. Does it have a force majeure clause? Does it list currency restrictions as a triggering event?

Second, remember MUR Shipping. If the contract says dollars, the US company is entitled to dollars. They don't have to accept pesos, even if it would cost them nothing to convert.

Third, advise your client to negotiate. Propose an amendment. Offer to bear conversion costs. But don't assume the other side must accept.

Fourth, for future contracts, draft better force majeure clauses. Include currency restrictions. Include language about alternative performance.

This is practical law. This is why we study cases."

---

### [53:30] MODULE SUMMARY

**[On screen: Key takeaways checklist]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Let's summarize what you've learned in Module 2.

**[Checkmarks appear as instructor reads]**

✅ Common law contracts require offer, acceptance, consideration, and intent. Mexican law uses *consentimiento*, *objeto*, and *causa* instead.

✅ Force majeure must be explicitly included in common law contracts. Unlike Mexico, there's no automatic protection.

✅ 'Reasonable endeavours' does not require accepting non-contractual performance. MUR Shipping made that clear.

✅ *Pacta sunt servanda*—the contract terms as written control. Write carefully.

✅ Mexican lawyers must draft force majeure clauses explicitly when working with international contracts.

You're now equipped to discuss contract formation across legal systems, analyze force majeure clauses, and advise clients on the implications of the MUR Shipping decision."
