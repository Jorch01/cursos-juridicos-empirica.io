### [00:00] OPENING

**[On screen: Module 2 title card with contract imagery]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Welcome back to Anglo-American Law in Action. I'm Jorge Clemente, and this is Module 2: Contract Law Fundamentals.

In Module 1, we explored how courts work in the US and UK. Today, we're going to dive into something every lawyer deals with daily—contracts. But we're not just learning theory. We're going to analyze a real case from the UK Supreme Court decided in May 2024: MUR Shipping versus RTI.

**[On screen: Learning objectives appear]**

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Identify the essential elements of a valid contract in common law
- Understand key differences between US, UK, and Mexican contract law  
- Apply contract terminology in professional contexts
- And analyze how force majeure clauses work when sanctions get involved

This is practical knowledge. If you work with international clients, advise on cross-border transactions, or draft contracts with common law parties, you need this.

Let's begin."

### [01:45] CONNECTING TO MODULE 1

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Quick connection to our last module. Remember we talked about how common law systems work differently from our civil law system in Mexico? Courts in the US and UK follow precedent—*stare decisis*. 

The case we study today, MUR Shipping, is now binding precedent in England. Every force majeure dispute will be analyzed in light of this decision. That's why understanding landmark cases matters—they become the law.

Now, let's build your vocabulary."

# SEGMENT 2: WARM-UP — VOCABULARY
## ⏱️ TIMECODE: 02:30 - 12:00

---

### [02:30] VOCABULARY INTRODUCTION

**[On screen: Vocabulary table with 12 terms]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Before we dive into the case, you need the language. Let me introduce twelve essential contract law terms. These aren't just words for an exam—you'll use them in emails, negotiations, and contracts throughout your career.

Let's go through them:

**[Point to each term as you explain]**

**OFFER** — A clear proposal to enter into an agreement on specific terms. In Spanish, *oferta*. The person making the offer is the *offeror*. Remember: an offer must be definite and communicated.

**ACCEPTANCE** — Agreement to the exact terms of an offer. *Aceptación* in Spanish. Here's the key: acceptance must mirror the offer perfectly. If you change anything, it becomes a counter-offer, not acceptance.

**CONSIDERATION** — This is the big one. Something of value exchanged between parties. In Spanish... well, there's no exact equivalent. We might say *contraprestación*, but Mexican law doesn't require consideration—we use *causa* instead. This difference is crucial.

**[Pause for emphasis]**

**BREACH** — Failure to perform a contractual obligation. *Incumplimiento*. When someone doesn't do what the contract requires, that's a breach.

**DAMAGES** — Money compensation for loss caused by breach. *Daños y perjuicios*. This is the most common remedy in common law.

**FORCE MAJEURE** — Say it with me: 'force mah-ZHUR.' It's French, meaning superior force. An unforeseeable event that prevents contract performance. Like the pandemic. Like... sanctions. We'll spend a lot of time on this today.

**REASONABLE ENDEAVOURS** — The efforts a reasonable person would make to overcome an obstacle. Note the British spelling: E-N-D-E-A-V-O-U-R-S. Americans spell it without the 'u.' This phrase is central to our case.

**REMEDY** — The legal means to enforce a right or compensate for a wrong. *Recurso* or *remedio*. When something goes wrong, you need a remedy.

**PARTY** — A person or company that enters into a contract. *Parte*. We say 'the parties to the contract.'

**PERFORMANCE** — Carrying out contractual obligations. *Cumplimiento*. Good performance means doing what you promised.

**CLAUSE** — A specific provision or section within a contract. *Cláusula*. Clause 36, clause 12, and so on.

**SANCTION** — A penalty or restriction imposed by government. *Sanción*. US sanctions played a key role in our case today.

Now let's practice with two exercises."

### [06:30] EXERCISE 1 — MATCHING

**[On screen: Exercise 1 displayed]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Look at Exercise 1 in your worksheet. You need to match terms 1 through 8 with definitions a through h.

**[Pause indicator appears on screen: "PAUSE VIDEO — Complete Exercise 1 — 2 minutes"]**

Pause the video now and complete the matching exercise. You have about two minutes.

**[Beat]**

Ready? Let's check your answers.

**[Answers appear on screen one by one as instructor reads]**

Number 1, OFFER, matches with **C** — a proposal to enter into an agreement.

Number 2, ACCEPTANCE, matches with **E** — agreement to the terms proposed. Remember, exact agreement.

Number 3, CONSIDERATION, matches with **G** — value exchanged between parties. The *quid pro quo*.

Number 4, BREACH, matches with **F** — failure to fulfill a contractual duty.

Number 5, DAMAGES, matches with **A** — money paid to compensate for a loss.

Number 6, FORCE MAJEURE, matches with **B** — an event beyond control that prevents performance.

Number 7, REMEDY, matches with **H** — legal solution to enforce a right.

And number 8, PARTY, matches with **D** — a person or company in a contract.

How did you do? If you got 7 or 8 correct, excellent. If you missed a few, review the vocabulary list before continuing."

### [09:00] EXERCISE 2 — GAP-FILL

**[On screen: Exercise 2 with word box]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Now Exercise 2. You have a word box with eight terms. Use them to complete the sentences below.

**[Pause indicator: "PAUSE VIDEO — Complete Exercise 2 — 3 minutes"]**

Pause and complete Exercise 2. Three minutes.

**[Beat]**

Let's review.

**[Each sentence appears, then the answer fills in with highlight effect]**

Sentence 1: 'When Company A proposes terms, they make an...' **OFFER** '...to Company B.'

Sentence 2: 'If Company B agrees to all the terms, this constitutes...' **ACCEPTANCE**.

Sentence 3: 'In common law, a contract requires...' **CONSIDERATION** '—something of value from both sides.' This is what makes common law contracts different from Mexican contracts.

Sentence 4: 'When a party fails to perform, this is called a...' **BREACH** '...of contract.'

Sentence 5: 'The injured party may seek...' **DAMAGES** '...as compensation in court.'

Sentence 6: 'A...' **FORCE MAJEURE** '...clause excuses performance when unforeseeable events occur.'

Sentence 7: 'The contract required the parties to use...' **REASONABLE ENDEAVOURS** '...to overcome any obstacles.' This exact phrase will be critical in our case.

Sentence 8: 'The court will determine the appropriate...' **REMEDY** '...for the breach.'

Perfect. You now have the vocabulary foundation. Let's move to understanding how contracts actually form under common law."

# SEGMENT 3: READING — CONTRACT FORMATION
## ⏱️ TIMECODE: 12:00 - 25:00

---

### [12:00] TEXT INTRODUCTION

**[On screen: Reading text displayed in elegant format]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Open your worksheet to Part 2: Reading. We have a text about the essential elements of a valid contract. I want you to read along as I explain the key concepts. You'll see some Latin terms—I'll explain each one.

Let's read together.

**[Text appears section by section]**

'In Anglo-American common law, a valid contract requires four essential elements: offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations.'

Four elements. Let me emphasize: in Mexico, we talk about *consentimiento*, *objeto*, and *causa*. Different framework. Common law requires these four specific elements.

**[Highlight Latin phrase]**

'An offer must be clear, definite, and communicated to the offeree. The principle of *consensus ad idem*—meeting of minds—means both parties must agree on the same terms.'

*Consensus ad idem*. Write that down. Say it: con-SEN-sus ad EE-dem. Meeting of minds. Both parties understanding and agreeing to the same thing. If I think we're agreeing to payment in dollars and you think we're agreeing to payment in pesos, there's no *consensus ad idem*.

**[Continue with text]**

'Acceptance must mirror the offer exactly—any changes constitute a counter-offer. This is called the mirror image rule.'

The mirror image rule is strict in common law. If I offer to sell you a car for $10,000 and you say 'I accept, but I'll pay $9,500,' that's NOT acceptance. That's a counter-offer. The original offer dies.

**[Highlight consideration section]**

'Consideration is uniquely important in common law. Each party must provide something of value: money, goods, services, or even a promise to do—or not do—something.'

Here's where Mexican lawyers get confused. In Mexico, you can have a valid contract based on a promise. In common law? A promise without consideration is a gift. Unenforceable. You need the *quid pro quo*—something for something."

---

### [15:30] FORCE MAJEURE EXPLANATION

**[On screen: Force majeure section highlighted]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Now here's where we connect to our case.

'When unforeseen events prevent performance, parties may invoke force majeure—*vis major* in Latin. However, unlike Mexican law where *caso fortuito* is codified in the Civil Code, common law has no general doctrine of force majeure.'

Let me be absolutely clear on this point. In Mexico, Article 2111 of the Civil Code provides protection for *caso fortuito* and *fuerza mayor*. It's automatic. It's in the law.

**[Emphatic gesture]**

In English law? Nothing. If you want force majeure protection, you must write it into your contract. No clause, no protection. This is why contract drafting is so critical in common law jurisdictions.

**[Final paragraph]**

'The recent UK Supreme Court case MUR Shipping BV v. RTI Ltd [2024] clarified that reasonable endeavours to overcome force majeure does not require accepting non-contractual performance. The court upheld the principle of *pacta sunt servanda*—agreements must be kept as written.'

*Pacta sunt servanda*. PAK-tah soont ser-VAN-dah. Agreements must be kept. The contract says dollars, you get dollars. The contract says delivery in June, delivery is in June. What you wrote is what you must do."

### [17:30] COMPARATIVE TABLE

**[On screen: US/UK/Mexico comparison table]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Look at the comparative table in your worksheet. Let's walk through the key differences.

**[Point to each row]**

**Basic requirements:** US and UK need offer, acceptance, and consideration. Mexico needs *consentimiento*, *objeto*, and *causa*. Similar but not identical concepts.

**Consideration:** Required in US and UK. Not required in Mexico—we use *causa* instead. This is the biggest difference. A Mexican lawyer might draft a contract perfectly valid in Mexico that would be unenforceable in New York because there's no consideration.

**Written form:** Common law has the Statute of Frauds requiring writing for certain contracts—land sales, contracts over a year, and so on. Mexico generally requires more contracts in writing. Know which contracts need formal documentation.

**Force majeure:** Must be in the contract in US and UK. In Mexico, it's in the Civil Code. When advising clients on international contracts, always include force majeure clauses explicitly.

**Good faith:** This is interesting. In Mexico, *buena fe* permeates everything. In the US, the UCC implies good faith in performance. In the UK, the courts are more reluctant to imply good faith obligations. Don't assume good faith requirements transfer across systems."

### [20:00] EXERCISE 3 — TRUE/FALSE

**[On screen: Exercise 3]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Time for Exercise 3. True or False questions. If the statement is false, you need to correct it.

**[Pause indicator: "PAUSE VIDEO — Complete Exercise 3 — 3 minutes"]**

Pause the video. Complete the five true/false questions.

**[Beat]**

Let's check.

**[Statements appear with answers]**

Statement 1: 'In common law, consideration is optional for contract validity.'

This is **FALSE**. Consideration is REQUIRED for contract validity in common law. Without consideration, you don't have an enforceable contract—just a promise.

Statement 2: 'The mirror image rule means acceptance must match the offer exactly.'

**TRUE**. That's exactly what it means. Any variation creates a counter-offer.

Statement 3: 'Mexican law requires consideration just like US and UK law.'

**FALSE**. Mexican law does NOT require consideration. We use *causa* instead—the purpose or reason for the contract. Different concept.

Statement 4: 'Force majeure is automatically implied in all English law contracts.'

**FALSE**. Force majeure must be EXPLICITLY INCLUDED. There is no automatic or implied force majeure in English law. This trips up many civil law lawyers.

Statement 5: '*Pacta sunt servanda* means contracts must be performed as agreed.'

**TRUE**. Agreements must be kept. Exactly as written."

---

### [23:00] EXERCISES 4 & 5

**[On screen: Exercises 4 and 5]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**

"Quickly complete Exercises 4 and 5. Exercise 4 has comprehension questions. Exercise 5 asks you to find words in the text matching definitions.

**[Pause indicator: "PAUSE VIDEO — Complete Exercises 4 & 5 — 4 minutes"]**

Pause now. Four minutes.

**[Beat]**

Exercise 4 answers:

Question 1: The four essential elements are **offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations**.

Question 2: The mirror image rule requires that **acceptance must exactly match the offer. Any changes constitute a counter-offer, not acceptance**. It's important because it ensures both parties agree to identical terms.

Question 3: Mexican law differs because **it does not require consideration. Instead, Mexican law uses *causa*—the underlying purpose of the contract.**

Question 4: Force majeure clauses must be explicit because **common law has no general doctrine of force majeure. Unlike Mexican law where *caso fortuito* is codified, English law only recognizes force majeure if the contract specifically includes such a clause.**

Exercise 5—find the words:

1. Meeting of minds: ***consensus ad idem***
2. Something given in exchange: **consideration** or ***quid pro quo***
3. Agreements must be kept: ***pacta sunt servanda***
4. Superior force preventing performance: **force majeure** or ***vis major***
5. Acceptance must exactly match the offer: **mirror image rule**

Excellent. You now understand contract formation. Let's hear how this plays out in a real case."
